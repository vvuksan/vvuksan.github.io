My friend [Igor Je≈°e](http://twitter.com/mockupscreens) who is an all around awesome guy recently wrote a new piece of commercial software called [MockupData](http://www.MockupData.com) that allows you to create realistic sample data you can use to test your applications. Without further ado you can read the [press release about MockupData here](http://www.mockupscreens.com/blog/?p=174) and [newsletter announcement](http://www.mockupscreens.com/blog/?p=180). If you have a need for such a tool I would highly recommend Igor's software.

This is not Igor's first product. Prior to MockupData he wrote a tool called [Mockupscreens](http://MockupScreens.com) which let's you create mockups easily.
