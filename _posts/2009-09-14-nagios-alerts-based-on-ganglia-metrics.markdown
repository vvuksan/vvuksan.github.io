Have you ever wanted to alert based on Ganglia metrics. Well you can :-)

You can find the source code [here](http://vuksan.com/linux/ganglia/check_ganglia_metric.phps) for the plug in here.

Instructions how to set it up are [here](http://vuksan.com/linux/nagios_scripts.html#check_ganglia_metrics).
