In my previous I introduced [Testing your web pages with fantomtest](http://blog.vuksan.com/2011/08/02/testing-your-web-pages-with-fantomtest/). I have recently added ability to test the same page from multiple sites within the same interface. You simply install the copy of fantomTest on a remote site then configure your primary site to access it. For example this is a test of Google from my laptop.

Slightly different since Google redirects me to their localized Google site however it leads me to believe that it's my connection that is slow not Google.

Any number ofÂ  "remotes" can be added. Want it ? Get it @GitHub
