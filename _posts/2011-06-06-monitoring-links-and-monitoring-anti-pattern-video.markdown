John Vincent aka. [lusis](https://twitter.com/lusis) has started an interesting conversation surrounding monitoring on Freenode on channel he named ##monitoringsucks. He has also done an awesome job of starting up a Github project of the same name that is shaping up to be a nice collection of links to tools and blog posts. Check it out

Also we just got a hold of  the monitoring anti-patterns Ignite Talk from [Devopsdays Boston](http://devopsdays.org/) by Alexis Lê-Quôc aka. [@alq](https://twitter.com/#!/alq). It is a short video (5 minutes) so it's definitely worth seeing.
