<p>Some time ago I saw a demo on using Graphite (<a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">http://graphite.wikidot.com/</a>). I was impressed by the ease of creating custom graphs and the quality/visual appeal of the graphs. Trouble was that Graphite uses it’s own storage engine instead of RRD and I figured it may be too much work to figure out how to inject my existing <a href="http://ganglia.info/">Ganglia</a> metrics.</p>

<p>Couple days ago I saw a tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebrittain">Mike Brittain</a> at Etsy on how Graphite is becoming one of his favorite graphing tools. I know that they use Ganglia at Etsy so I asked if/how they use integration between Graphite and Ganglia. He pointed me in the direction of <a href="http://twitter.com/kastner">Erik Kastner</a> who has done Ganglia Graphite integration. I asked him if he could post the patches and he was gracious to do so. In a nutshell he uses RRD files directly and rsyncs them every few minutes. While trying to install Graphite I realized that injecting metrics into Graphite is really simple. For example graphite-web contains a simple client example that injects system load. All it does is connects to port 2003 of the graphite installation and sends a following payload</p>

<pre><code>system.loadavg_1min 0.08 1285763852
system.loadavg_5min 0.02 1285763852
system.loadavg_15min 0.01 1285763852
</code></pre>

<p>That’s simple :-) ie. some type of a metric name, value and what looks like current UNIX timestamp. I then remembered that <a href="https://twitter.com/georgiou">Kostas Georgiou</a> showed me a ruby script that connects to gmond, retrieves the XML for the host, parses it and adds to <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/">Facter</a>. Unfortunately that didn’t seem to have much value until now :-). What I did  is change Kostas’ script to send metrics to Graphite instead of adding them to facter. You can find the result at <a href="http://github.com/ganglia/ganglia_contrib/tree/master/graphite_integration/">Ganglia Add-Ons GitHub repository</a>. You can run the script either from cron or as a daemon.</p>

<p>There are two ways to do this. I have tested only the first way. I am not sure if the graphite receiver would freak out if it gets too many metrics in a payload. Let me know if you know :-).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run this script on every host that runs gmond. This may be somewhat tricky since I usually set up gmond to only send metrics and turn off receiving by setting deaf = yes. For this approach to work you have to turn on receiving. To make it more secure we’ll just listen on loopback. In global make sure you have these settings</p>

    <p>mute = no
   deaf = no</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the rest of the section make sure you add/have</p>

<pre><code>udp_send_channel {
  host = 127.0.0.1
  port = 8649
  ttl = 1
}
udp_recv_channel {
 bind = 127.0.0.1
 port = 8649
}
tcp_accept_channel {
   bind = 127.0.0.1
   port = 8649
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
  <li>Run this on the main gmond collector daemon. Main gmond collector daemon will have metrics from all hosts. Trouble is that I haven’t tested injecting thousands of metrics in a single payload. I’m sure there is a way around it and perhaps someone can post a patch :-D.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>

<p>I can think of couple possible improvements</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is a rewrite of gmetad written in Python. It supports plugins. I don’t think it would be a stretch to add a plug-in where gmetad sends data to Graphite when it updates the RRDs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently metrics are sent as <hostname>.<metric_name>. It may make sense to send them into the appropriate part of the tree ie. <type_of_metric>.<hostname>.<metric_name> e.g. database.web1.mysql_selects</metric_name></hostname></type_of_metric></metric_name></hostname></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better integrate Ganglia Web UI and Graphite. Graphite supports flexible URL parameters so this should be doable.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And obligatory screenshots. This is the stacked graph I created in 20 seconds :-)</p>
