<p>Next Boston DevOps meetup we’ll try something new, Jeff Buchbinder of <a href="http://freemedsoftware.org/">FreeMed Software</a> fame and myself will talk about “Deploying your way into happiness”. If you want flavor of the kinds of things we’ll talk about you can check out my <a href="http://blog.vuksan.com/2010/04/09/devops-homebrew/">Devops homebrew</a> post. We will go into much more detail with actual code snippets and some of the omitted nitty gritty details. We will also open the floor for questions.</p>

<p>Date for the meetup is August 3rd, 2010 from 6-8 pm and we’ll be meeting at Microsoft’s New England R&amp;D center. I expect we’ll start presenting around 6:45 or so.</p>
