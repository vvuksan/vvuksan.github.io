<p>I am a big believer in adding context to alerts. This allows the recipient of an alert to make a better decision on how to deal with an alert. It’s often hard to classify alerts so providing as much context to the alert is extremely helpful. For instance if I am alerting on a value of a metric I like to attach an image of that metric for the past hour. This way if I am on my mobile phone and out and about I have the alerting metric graph right there without needing to open up another window or having to start up my laptop.</p>

<p>In more recent versions of Ganglia there is an option to add <a href="http://ganglia.info/?p=382">overlay events</a> to hosts which show up as vertical lines on the graph. I figured that would be great context to add to alerts. Since I’m using Nagios I decided to extend a mail handler I used before to query Ganglia events database and include any events that were connected to the matching host in 24 hours. This helps in a number of  scenarios to keep team on the same page and well informed e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There was a code push/config change however host/service was not scheduled for maintenance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent code push is causing issues ie. web servers are crashing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is an example e-mail you get</p>

<p>As an added bonus mail handler sends all alerts to a <a href="https://github.com/cluenet/cluemon/blob/master/nagios-bin/nagiosbot.py">Nagios Bot</a> :-). Now all you need to make sure is to record events for any major changes. You could do a lot of these things automatically by e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Adding hooks to your startup scripts so that when you purposely restart services it is logged</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watching logs then inserting proper events in the timeline. App stoppe</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Querying external services e.g. Dynect provides an API to query zone changes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the mail handler from here</p>
