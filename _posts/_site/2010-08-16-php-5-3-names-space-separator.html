<p>I am posting this to help others that may encounter a similar problem.</p>

<p>I have been doing some PHP development recently using <a href="http://github.com/nrk/predis/">Predis</a>, a PHP <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> library. While instantiating the Redis\Client object I get</p>

<pre><code>Warning: Unexpected character in input:  '\' (ASCII=92) state=1 in .....
</code></pre>

<p>Problem was explained in this issue</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/nrk/predis/issues/closed#issue/11">http://github.com/nrk/predis/issues/closed#issue/11</a></p>

<p>If you are still running on PHP 5.2 you should use the backported  version of Predis and not the mainline library which targets only PHP  &gt;= 5.3 (the <em><strong>backslash is the namespace separator</strong></em> in PHP 5.3).</p>
