<p>I have recently moved this blog to be hosted on <a href="http://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>, a CDN service with bunch of great features like dynamic content caching with instant purges. Fastly utilizes HTTP headers to determine what to cache as described in the <a href="http://www.fastly.com/docs/tutorials#cache_control">Cache Control document</a>. While configuring my service I noticed that my Wordpress (origin server) kept returning HTTP headers like these</p>

<pre><code>Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Pragma: no-cache
</code></pre>

<p>I looked through the Wordpress code and couldnâ€™t see where such value was set. After some internet searches I discovered that they are set using session-cache-limiter option in php.ini. In most distributions this defaults to nocache which ends up with above headers. You can read more on the cache-limiter options here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-cache-limiter.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-cache-limiter.php</a></p>

<p>What we need is session-cache-limiter = public results in headers like these</p>

<pre><code>Expires: (sometime in the future, according session.cache_expire)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=(sometime in the future, according to session.cache_expire)
Last-Modified: (the timestamp of when the session was last saved)
</code></pre>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Expires: Tue, 22 May 2012 16:38:33 GMT
Cache-Control: public, max-age=10800
Last-Modified: Tue, 04 Oct 2005 00:55:59 GMT
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to adjust the max-age you can set cache-expire in php.ini e.g.</p>

<pre><code>; http://php.net/session.cache-expire
session.cache_expire = 180
</code></pre>
