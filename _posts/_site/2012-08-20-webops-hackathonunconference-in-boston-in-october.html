<p>Few weeks ago I posed a question on Twitter whether there would be interest to organize a webops hackathon Â  I am close to getting confirmation for conference space at <a href="http://microsoftcambridge.com/">Microsoft NERD</a> for October 11, 2012. Now comes the hard part :-). We need to figure out what format should hackathon and unconference take as well as what topics we should talk about. There is going to be a monitoring conference at the end of March spearheaded by Jason Dixon (<a href="https://twitter.com/obfuscurity">@obfuscurity</a>) so we may want to leave out monitoring topics.</p>

<p>In a nutshell we need to decide</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How much of the event should be a hackathon and how much should be an (un)conference</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want talks what topics should we seek talks for e.g. continuous integration, noSQL, site scalability, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Name of the event :-)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any ideas send me an e-mail conference X vuksan.com (replace X with you know what).</p>
