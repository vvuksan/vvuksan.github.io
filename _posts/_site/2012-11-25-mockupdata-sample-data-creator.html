<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/mockupscreens">Igor Ješe</a> who is an all around awesome guy recently wrote a new piece of commercial software called <a href="http://www.MockupData.com">MockupData</a> that allows you to create realistic sample data you can use to test your applications. Without further ado you can read the <a href="http://www.mockupscreens.com/blog/?p=174">press release about MockupData here</a> and <a href="http://www.mockupscreens.com/blog/?p=180">newsletter announcement</a>. If you have a need for such a tool I would highly recommend Igor’s software.</p>

<p>This is not Igor’s first product. Prior to MockupData he wrote a tool called <a href="http://MockupScreens.com">Mockupscreens</a> which let’s you create mockups easily.</p>
