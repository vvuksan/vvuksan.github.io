<p>Few months ago I got myself an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/50">Arduino Uno board from Adafruit</a>.
I have had couple use cases I was going to try to use them for in order of importance</p>

<ol>
  <li>Water leak detection e.g. put a sensor in crawl space or attic for early detection of water leaks</li>
  <li>Garage door open/close state - find out if the garage door has been left open</li>
  <li>Humidity and temperature monitoring around the house</li>
</ol>

<p>One nice thing about Arduino is that some of the small boards are really inexpensive. 
For example <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardNano">Arduino Nano board</a> or 
<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1501">Adafruit Trinket</a> can run you anywhere between $3.50-$7.</p>

<p>After receiving the board and playing with some of the basic examples I figured it was time to resolve
how to push sensor data to a central location. Some of the options I discovered were as follows</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/128">XBee modules</a>. Approx cost per module ~ $20</li>
  <li>Bluetooth - Approx cost per module $7</li>
  <li>315/433 Mhz remote control - Approx cost per module ~ $1</li>
  <li>Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L01+ modules - Approx cost per module ~ $1</li>
</ol>

<p>XBee and Bluetooth are really nice options however I considered them too overpriced for this particular
use case so I went ahead and bought a pair of 433 Mhz and nRF24L01+ modules.</p>

<h2 id="mhz-modules">315/433MHz modules</h2>

<p>First thing I tried was 433 MHz modules. They were easy to wire and configure since e.g. transmitter
has only 3 pins and receiver 4 pins (although you only use 3) and using the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/">rc-switch project libraries</a> I was able to communicate between
my Arduino and a Raspberry Pi. The drawback is that it’s fairly low bandwidth and payload size maxes
out at 24 bit so pretty limiting.</p>

<p>That said an interesting side benefit of these modules is that large number of remote controlled power
outlets out there use either 315/433 Mhz bands e.g. <a href="http://www.etekcity.com/c-59-outlets.aspx">Etekcity outlets</a>.
If you have a remote controlled device in your house you can look up what frequency it uses with 
<a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/">FCC ID search</a>. There is also the 303 Mhz frequency however
I have not been able to find the modules for it yet.</p>

<p>As a result of this tinkering I know am able to turn outlets around my house with my phone :-).</p>

<h2 id="nordic-semiconductor-nrf24l01">Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L01+</h2>

<p>These are a lot more tricky to get going as they have total of 8 pins with one unused and it is
easy to mis-wire things. It took me a lot of trying to get these going however I finally got it
going and was able to pass data between the Arduino and a Raspberry Pi. Max payload on this
is 32 bytes which should be enough for shipping out metric data and you can ship them at a pretty
rapid rate. Libraries I ended up using were these</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stanleyseow/RF24">RF24 library</a> and <a href="https://github.com/riyas-org/nrf24pihub/">NRF24PiHub</a></p>

<p>Do note that these may not work with Adafruit’s Trinket.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>I have ordered some <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/dht">temperature and humidity sensors</a>,
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Water-Level-Sensor-Module-for-Arduino-AVR-ARM-STM3/">water sensors</a>
and some Arduino Nanos and will be wiring it up :-), shiping metrics to <a href="http://ganglia.info/">Ganglia</a>
and alerting on it.</p>
