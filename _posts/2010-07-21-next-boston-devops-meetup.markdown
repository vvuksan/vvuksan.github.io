Next Boston DevOps meetup we'll try something new,Â Jeff Buchbinder of [FreeMed Software](http://freemedsoftware.org/) fame and myself will talk about "Deploying your way into happiness". If you want flavor of the kinds of things we'll talk about you can check out my [Devops homebrew](http://blog.vuksan.com/2010/04/09/devops-homebrew/) post. We will go into much more detail with actual code snippets and some of the omitted nitty gritty details. We will also open the floor for questions.

Date for the meetup is August 3rd, 2010 from 6-8 pm and we'll be meeting at Microsoft's New England R&D center. I expect we'll start presenting around 6:45 or so.
